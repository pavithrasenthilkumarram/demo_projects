In this repository "demo_projects", there exists two machine learning projects. Both the projects are just demo of how prediction model works.  Here you can just make use of the code for reference and make your own models. The simple steps of working of both the projects include
1. Understanding about the project and outcome.
2. Understanding about the model to be built.
3. Implementation of model on a suitable programming language.
4. Execution of the model for the required result.

The first project would be the prediction of performance score of the CPUs. (py_code)
The second project would be the prediction of train delay based on past 30 days of data.
